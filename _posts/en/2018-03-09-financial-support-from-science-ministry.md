Scenarex gets financial support from the Ministry of “Économie, Science et Innovation” of the Quebec government!

Through the program “Premier Brevet”, we will receive financial assistance in the form of a non-refundable contribution to our actual patent expenditures up to a maximum of $25,000.

This is another tangible proof of our achievement with our Bookchain® solution and its development.

We would like to thank Julien Lachere, our patent agent, and Amber M Beckley, PhD, for the very valuable assistance provided in this case. Once again, all this is made possible thanks to the BCF Imagine program and the entire BCF Avocats d’affaires team.
