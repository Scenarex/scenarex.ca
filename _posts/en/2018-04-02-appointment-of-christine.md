It is with great pleasure and pride that I officially announce the appointment of Christine Joly as Strategic Director at Scenarex.

Christine has been working closely with our organization for over a year now, but is now jumping full time in our adventure.
She joins the rest of our development team, including our Technology Director Steve Breault, at WeWork’s offices at Place Ville Marie in downtown Montreal.

Christine holds a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) from ESG and a Master of Science degree (M.Sc.) in Marketing from HEC Montréal and has held management positions in commerce and retail for 10 years. For the past 4 years, she has been working as a strategic advisor with organizations all across Quebec, especially for the Federation of Worker’s coop (Réseau COOP). She has worked with over 100 entrepreneurs, acting as a coach at the start-up level and providing support and guidance through growth and development.

Her extensive experience and leadership, combined with her communications, marketing and strategic development skills make her the perfect candidate to implement the strategy to bring our Bookchain® solution to market.

I have no doubt that having Christine on our team will make the deployment of our activities, starting with our Bookchain® solution a great success!
