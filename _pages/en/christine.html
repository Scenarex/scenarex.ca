    <h2 class="big">Christine Joly</h2>
    <p>A marketing and business strategy maniac, a nerd despite herself, and a little bit of a (e)bookworm, Christine has been collaborating with Scenarex since 2017. Doggedly determined to translate all of the Blockchain lingo into understandable language, she just joined the management team and also holds the unofficial – yet very important – title of Blockchain translator.</p>
    <p>Christine has over 10 years of management experience in retail, sales, and commerce. In addition, she has worked for over 4 years as a coach and a strategic advisor, consulting with over a hundred companies, both at the start-up and growth level. She holds a Bachelor of Business Administration (B.B.A.) and a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Marketing.</p>
    <p>Christine leads the development of our strategic marketing and business development plans and oversees their implementation.</p>
