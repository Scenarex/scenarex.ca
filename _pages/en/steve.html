    <h2 class="big">Steve Breault</h2>
    <p>An overly responsible coder - to his own despair - and a rebel at heart, Steve could not resist the blockchain challenge and joined the team in 2018. An experienced technology architect, he has extensive experience in defining IT solutions and software development. He is also a proficient professional in business process design, database design, scripted and object-oriented languages, as well as mobile development.</p>
    <p>Steve oversees all technological aspects of the development and production of our software and its underlying infrastructure.</p>
