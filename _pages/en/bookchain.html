      <p>Bookchain® is a newer, more flexible version of other well-established DRM services. Because we’ve built it with the goal of empowering publishers and content creators, we’ve decided to call it a Digital Rights Enabler (DRE).</p><p>Bookchain® is an innovative solution, built on blockchain, that allows authors and publishers to configure the security, traceability, attribution, and distribution settings (including lending and reselling) of a digital document.</p><p>While protecting and securing the digital documents against theft and piracy, our DRE lets readers access the files from any device with a web browser, without being locked into a specific ecosystem.

      <h2 class="mt">With it, we want to do 3 things</h2>
      <p>
        <i class="fas fa-child fa-3x fa-pull-left"></i>
        Empower writers and content creators to protect their rights and enable them to choose the way their work is distributed and shared with the world
      </p>
      <p>
        <i class="fas fa-chart-pie fa-3x fa-pull-left"></i>
        Allow publishers to better manage distribution, attribution and traceability of an author’s work

        <i class="far fa-money-bill-alt fa-3x fa-pull-left"></i>
        Bring to the market a blockchain service that can be used without any cryptocurrencies
      </p>
      <h2 class="mt">Who can use Bookchain®?</h2>
      <p>
        Bookchain® was specifically designed to fit the different needs of all those involved in the digital publishing industry. We created it to be fully adaptable to the reality of publishers, indie publishers and self-publishing authors.
      </p>
      <h2 class="mt">How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        Once users have created their account on our Bookchain® web platform, they can simply upload their digital file and easily fill out the smart contract which contains all the settings for the publishing and distribution of their digital file.

    <h2><i class="fas fa-lock"></i> SECURITY</h2>
    <p class="smaller">Bookchain® allows you to publish and distribute your work any way you choose. The smart contract enforces the parameters you define and keeps the encryption that protects the file from being illegally copied, transferred or worse, hacked.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="3u 12u(small)">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-thumbtack"></i> TRACEABILITY</h2>
    <p class="smaller">Each account on our user interface contains a dashboard providing comprehensive data and analytics of your published documents, making it easy to evaluate your work’s reach and track its impact with the audience.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="3u 12u(small)">
    <h2><i class="far fa-edit"></i> ATTRIBUTION</h2>
    <p class="smaller">The smart contract also contains all the metadata of the file. For ebooks, the Bookchain® interface is directly linked to an ISBN database, making it easy to fill out all the relevant information, identify the rights owners of the content and even specify and distribute the respective royalties.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="3u 12u(small)">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-share"></i> DISTRIBUTION</h2>
    <p class="smaller">Here’s where it gets even more interesting. Bookchain® gives authors and publishers the ability to enable the resale and lending of their ebooks, without involving a third party. All permissions and authorizations are programed in the smart contract at the time of publishing and are as flexible as the users wants them to be.</p>
