  Bookchain® is a new, flexible and innovative way of publishing, distributing and selling ebooks. It’s really a bunch of whole new features for your work.

  Bookchain® is an online platform, built on blockchain, that allows authors and publishers to configure the security, traceability, attribution, and distribution settings (including lending and reselling) of their ebooks and sell them through our catalogue.

  While protecting and securing the ebooks against theft and piracy, our solution lets readers access the files from any device with a web browser through our Web Reader.
who: Who can use Bookchain®?
whoText: >-
  Bookchain® was specifically designed to fit the different needs of all those involved in the publishing industry, although it initially has a focus on trade publishing (we had to start somewhere!). We created it to be fully adaptable to the reality of publishers, indie publishers and self-publishing authors.
how: How does it work?
howText: >-
  Once users have created their account on our Bookchain® web platform, they can start uploading their digital files and fill out the parameters of the smart contract, which contains all the settings for the publishing and distribution of the ebook, including royalty distribution, price, etc. Each smart contract is powered by the blockchain and can be assigned to several files.

  Once the ebook is attached to a smart contract, it’s ready to be published on the Bookchain® catalogue.

  Bookchain® allows you to publish and distribute your work any way you choose. The smart contract enforces the parameters you define and keeps the encryption that protects the file from being illegally copied, transferred or worse, hacked.

  The smart contract also contains all the metadata of the file. For ebooks, the Bookchain® interface is directly linked to an ISBN database, making it easy to fill out all the relevant information, identify the rights owners of the content and even specify and distribute the respective royalties.

reason4: Distribution
reason4Text: >-
  Here’s where it gets even more interesting. Bookchain® gives authors and publishers the ability to enable the resale and lending of their ebooks, without involving a third party. All permissions and authorizations are programed in the smart contract at the time of publishing and are as flexible as the users wants them to be.
