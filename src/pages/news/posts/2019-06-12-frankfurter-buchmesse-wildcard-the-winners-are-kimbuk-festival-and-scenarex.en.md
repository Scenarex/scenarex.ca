Frankfurt, 12 June 2019 – Seeking creatives for exhibition stand: In early March, Frankfurter Buchmesse (16-20 October 2019) launched the Wildcard campaign for the fifth time. Applicants with innovative product and marketing ideas could compete for a free 8-square-metre stand and win the Wildcard. A total of 377 innovative ideas for the publishing industry from 33 countries were submitted. The range of themes was vast: from a walk-through fairy-tale theme park and a tool for scientific peer reviews to a novel-based travel app.

**Wildcard 2019 (national)**

The winners of the Wildcard 2019 (national) are the Berlin-based activists behind the **KIMBUK Festival** and **KIMI-Siegel** (KIMI seal). Both the children’s book festival and children’s book seal honour diversity and inclusion in children’s books.

“Thank you for the exceptional opportunity to call the attention of such a large fair audience to the issue of diversity and sensitivity to discrimination in children’s and young adult literature! We are delighted to make our expertise available and to present books that have been awarded the KIMI seal, and we want to start conversations with authors, illustrators, publishers and all interested parties and invite them to join us in exploring ways to bring diversity into children’s books”, states Margarete Goj, publicist for the KIMBUK Festival and KIMI seal.

“I’m happy to have two winners that epitomise the themes of our times. KIMBUK fights for the representation of diverse identities, which should also be reflected in children’s books. And Scenarex’s bookchain proves that even the almost 600-year-old letterpress can be transferred into data blocks very profitably”, states Katja Böhne, Vice President Marketing & Communications at Frankfurter Buchmesse.
