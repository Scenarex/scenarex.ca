It is with great pride that we’ve learned our nomination as finalists for the OCTAS19 contest from [Réseau Action TI](https://www.actionti.com/).

<br>

Our founder and CEO, Simon-Pierre Marion, explains the significance of this contest:

"The OCTAS contest is a prestigious information technology (IT) event in the province of Quebec. Organized for over 30 years by the Réseau ACTION TI, it is the symbol of the efforts deployed by Quebec organizations in the development of IT and digital projects. This contest pays tribute to organizations and their individuals who made exceptional contributions to the progress of IT."

<br>

Scenarex is nominated in the _Startup_ category for their Bookchain® project. Mr. Marion reminds us that this is not a coincidence:

"Bookchain® is the result of our determination and perseverance in the development of a high-quality product, in order to help self-publishing authors and independent publishers to publish their digital books and to benefit from blockchain technology."

<br>

The whole Scenarex team wishes to thank the organizations that believed in the project and invested for its development and marketing. M. Marion continues:

"Bookchain® would not have been possible without the support of our precious collaborators, the Fonds des médias du Canada (CMF-FMC) and Copibec, who helped us financially throughout our adventure."

<br>

In addition to the CMF-FMC and Copibec, please note that Scenarex also received financial support from the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) and the Ministère de l'Économie et de l'Innovation du Québec.
