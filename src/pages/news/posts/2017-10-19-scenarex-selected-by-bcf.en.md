Here’s an amazing video showcasing the first 10 startups in the [BCF Imagine](https://www.facebook.com/BCFimagine/) program. And yes, Scenarex is part of it! [BCF Avocats d’affaires](https://www.facebook.com/BCFAvocats/) is a lot more than lawyers.

A special thank you to [Brigitte Nepveu](https://www.facebook.com/brigitte.nepveu.3), Jocelyn Auger and Julien Lacheré who have been helping us in our adventure.
