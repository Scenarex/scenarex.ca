description: >-
  A red-headed food (cough cough, dessert) lover and the youngest member of our team, Mackenzie has been with SCENAREX since 2018. Initially wanting to be a chemical engineer, she couldnâ€™t help but be seduced by the coding world, reoriented her career accordingly and now finds herself joyfully navigating the blockchain space.

  Her experience includes over 5 years of studies and internships as an IT analyst and application developer for both the public and private sector. She holds a Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.S.) in Chemical Engineering and Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Computer Technology.

  Mackenzie is in charge of the all aspects concerning the front-end development of our platforms, as well as ensuring an optimal user experience.
