It is with great pleasure and a lot of pride that I officially announce the appointment of Steve Breault as the Director of Technology at Scenarex. Steve is partnering with us in the great adventure of Scenarex as a full time employee. He will occupy a workspace at WeWork Place Ville-Marie in downtown Montreal, where he will collaborate easily with our partners from the Blocksense team, since they already occupy office space at the same location.

Steve is an experienced solutions architect and development lead with a demonstrated history in Web development. He has strong engineering professional skills in Business Process, noSQL databases, scripted and object oriented languages, and iOS mobile development. M. Breault is our technical lead overseeing all production aspects of our products.

I am certain that, with the addition of Steve in our team, our Bookchain solutionÂ® will be successful!
